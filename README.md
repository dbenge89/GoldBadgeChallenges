## Komodo Menu App
- The purpose of this app is to allow an imaginary cafe owner to CRUD her menu items in an app. 
- I worked on this one for a whle attempting to get a MVP. When I was done, I decided to go back and change how the meals were made by giving every individual part its own class. After constructing the new classes I implemented them in the meal class and this started the long and arduous process of allowing each individual item to have its own CRUD methods. There is probably a better way to do all of this but I am in week 4 of my coding bootcamp, and this was the way I implemented my own design. This is the challenge that I enjoyed the most and am most proud of. It is also the project that I learned the most from.
- There are an endless list of things that could be improved with this app, but a couple of things stand out the most to me. I need to cut a lot of the excess code from my project (i.e. redundant methods that could be implemented slightly different to work with more stuff). The second thing is that I need to polish it off and debug some more. There are a couple of things that need to be reformatted on the app portion and could stand to be smoother. If I had the time, I would also do some console formatting.
- This app was the app that I pushed my understanding of how an app interacts with the different namespaces that make it up. I had countless sessions of debugging where I would put a break in it and watch how my code would move throughout the project. I enjoyed it immensely, until I lost a lot of progress in a GitHub accident. Oops
## Komodo Claim App
- The purpose of this app is to show claims and pull claims from a database. 
- I had a working MVP on this fairly early on. I ended up getting stuck on a random part of the assignment where I need to pull up the next claim. I didn't implement it in the best way, but it works for my purposes. Every time the app is started, I forced it to set the current claim ID number and then use that in the get next claim method. Oh well. I had a lot of fun with this one too but I chose the Komodo Menu to be the one to delve into.
- I would improve a ton with this app. My console formatting is weak, some of the things don't work how I would like them to (getting the next claim), and overall it is a small app. I would definitely add the rest of the CRUD methods. I think from a usibility standpoint they're almost a necessity.
## Komodo Insurance Badge App
- The purpose of this app was to create a directory of badges and the doors that they had the clearance to open.
- Wish I would have started working on this one before the Menu Items honestly. After I started implementing different ways to bring up the doors that the badge would unlock, I found myself wishing I had more time specifically to work on that one. At one point while working on this, I had written a random badge generator and had a secondary menu where you could create new badges with random ID's or enter a new one that you chose. I ended up needing to scrap it for time, but it was pretty fun figuring that one out. 
- This one needs the regular improvements, it needs cleaned up, debugged some more, and the flow needs to be smoother. Also, I think given the time, I would add the random badge generator back.
## Conclusion
Overall this project was pretty fun and pretty nervewrecking. It was also a very quick way to get a deeper fundamental understanding of how to use and maintain .NET programs.
